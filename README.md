# GTEx-brain-sQTL

The present folder contains all scripts from the manuscript entitled 'Regional variation of splicing QTLs in the human brain'

These scripts are meant to provide additional transparency on the code underlying the results from the manuscript. 

Scripts are broken down by paragraph of the manuscripts and ordered following the flow of the manuscript. Within each script, code used for generating figures and tables is highlighted.

Note however that due to the computational nature of the analysis performed (some tables include several billions on lines) the scripts may require high memory to be run, or parallelization through a cluster. In addition, some parts of the analysis have been rewritten to improve clarity of the pipeline. In doing so, some bugs may have escaped our vigilance. Thus the code is provided without warranty. If you try to rerun these analyses and encounter any problem, please report it to the author ( yidazhang@g.ucla.edu ).
